# We recommend against using the following patterns because of the Swift Package Manager
# integration. However, if you have a legacy project, or have a reason to not commit
# the Pods directory, these can be used.
#
# Pods/
# Podfile.lock # if you want to regenerate lock file (discouraged)

# You can use the above patterns IF you're ONLY using SPM now, or have very specific
# reasons. For traditional CocoaPods use, do NOT uncomment Pods/ and Podfile.lock.

# Correct patterns for general CocoaPods use:
# (These lines are commonly included by Xcode's default .gitignore template or manually added)

# CocoaPods generated artifacts
# The Pods directory should generally NOT be checked in
Pods/

# The Pods project itself should NOT be checked in
# (It's part of the Pods/ directory, but explicitly listing it for clarity if needed)
# Pods/Pods.xcodeproj # This line is often redundant if Pods/ is ignored
